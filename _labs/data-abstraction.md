title: Data abstraction
summary: |
  In this laboratory, we explore the use of data abstraction to separate
  the interface of a type from its implementation.
note: |
  There was huge variation here.  Some students barely got to problem
  three, others made it through the first five.  No one got to six.
  Some students needed coaching not to use `car` and `cdr`.
more: |  
  It might be worth giving students different implementations in
  different files, and asking them to require them.

## Preparation

a. Have the traditional start-of-lab conversation.

b. Quickly review your answers to the self-check problems from the reading.

<!--
c. Decide which partner will be Side A and which partner will be Side B.

d. Grab your respective code files

* [data-abstraction-a.rkt](../code/labs/data-abstraction-a.rkt)
* [data-abstraction-b.rkt](../code/labs/data-abstraction-b.rkt)

e. Review any provided code at the top of the file.
-->

c. Grab the code file.

* [data-abstraction.rkt](../code/labs/data-abstraction.rkt)

d. Review the supplied procedures, which should be similar to those
from [the reading](../readings/data-abstraction).
