title: Patterns of recursion
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will continue your initial explorations with
  recursion, working to expand your approach to include patterns of recursion.
todo: 
  - TBD
---

In this lab, we'll further expand our understanding of recursion, considering how patterns of recursion and helper procedures can improve our ability to recurse.

## Preparation

<!--
a. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss work procedures, who
will submit the lab.

b. Decide who is side A and who is side B.  

A side: [recursion-patterns-a.rkt](../code/labs/recursion-patterns-a.rkt)

B side: [recursion-patterns-b.rkt](../code/labs/recursion-patterns-b.rkt)

c. Get started!
-->

a. Introduce yourself to our partner and discuss work procedures.

b. As you've likely figured out by now, the person closer to the board 
is Side A.  The other person is Side B.

c. The code may be found at 

* [recursion-patterns.rkt](../code/labs/recursion-patterns.rkt)
