title: Vectors
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will explore vectors, an alternative to
  lists for storing sequences of values.
note: | 
  Incredibly long lab.  Most students only got to problem 4.  What
  should we do?  Students need practice writing vector procedures.
  Perhaps two days on vectors?

## Preparation

a. If you have not done so, please conduct the normal "start of class
algorithm".  Introduce yourself to your partner.  Discuss work habits,
strengths, and areas to improve.

b. Grab the code for the lab.

* [vectors.rkt](../code/labs/vectors.rkt)

c. Grab the text of _Jane Eyre_.

* [pg1260.txt](../files/pg1260.txt)

d. Review the documentation for the supplied procedures to
ensure you understand what they are suposed to do.  If you're
not sure, feel free to experiment or to ask the staff.

## Acknowledgements

This lab has gone through many revisions throughout the years.
The earliest version available is available at
<https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CS151/2000F/Labs/vectors.html>
and appears to bear little resemblance to the current lab.  That
suggests that it has been updated by many hands over the years.
Samuel A. Rebelsky is likely responsible for the helper code.
