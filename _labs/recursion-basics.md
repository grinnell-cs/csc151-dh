title: Recursion basics
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will explore the basics of recursion over lists
  by reading and interpreting some recursive procedures.
todo: |
  For the in-person lab, most groups barely make it through problem 2.
  How do we make the lab shorter?  Maybe give them one trace and ask
  them to do the other.

In this lab, we'll gain some intuition about the *mechanics* of recursion by practicing reading and interpreting recursive code using our mental model of computation.

## Important procedures

## Preparation

a. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss work procedures, who
will submit the lab, other important issues.

<!--
b. Decide who is side A and who is side B.  

A side: [recursion-basics-a.rkt](../code/labs/recursion-basics-a.rkt)

B side: [recursion-basics-b.rkt](../code/labs/recursion-basics-b.rkt)
-->

b. Grab the code from the following location.  Side A will be the person
closer to the board.

* [recursion-basics.rkt](../code/labs/recursion-basics.rkt)

c. Review the procedures included in the lab to make sure you
understand what they are intended to do.
