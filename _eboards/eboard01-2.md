* Debrief on activity

Administrative stuff
--------------------

_Please take a playing card, if you didn't already._

### Introductory Notes

* Hi, I'm Sam (or SamR).
* Our class mentors are ...
    * Micah
    * Nameera
    * Hallie
    * "Model students"
    * "Near peers"
    * Mentors help you during class time.
    * Mentors hold mentor sessions.
    * Mentors are here to help you learn.
    * Mentors are also available to talk about broader issues (e.g., how
      the course is going, the CS or Psych majors)
* The class Web site is at 
  <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2022Sp/>.
    * I will email you the link.
    * The class Web site is (always) a work in progress, but is
      particularly behind this year.  Sorry!
* CSC-151 is *an introductory course in computer science*.
    * You can succeed (and even excel) with no prior experience.
      (Those with no prior experience sometimes spend more time.)
    * We approach material differently than many other intro CS courses;
      prior experience may help, but it may also hinder.  For example,
      we will not let you re-assign variables.  (Don't worry if you
      don't know what that means.)
* CSC-151 is *a community*.  We come from multiple cultures and backgrounds.
  Treat each other with respect and learn to appreciate what each person
  can contribute.
    * We will return to this issue and the associated learning outcomes
      throughout the semester.
* I type our online class notes in a format called "markdown".  You should
  find it relatively readable.  It permits me to make "nice" Web pages.
    * Sam: Don't forget to show off today's eboard.
    * Don't just rely on my notes; There is good evidence that taking your 
      own notes helps you learn.
* I will record many of our class sessions using Team.

### Other introductory stuff

* The CS department maintains a mailing list.  Let me know if you'd like
  to be added.  (Conveniently, the question is on our intro survey.)
* We provide supplies in this classroom to support you in working
  and learning.
    * Small cards to serve as flashcards, which are a good learning technique.
    * Also medium-sized grided post-it pads.
    * And pens.
* I prefer to have you book office hours.  First priority in any time
  slot goes to those who book.  https:/bit.ly/book-samr
    * If those don't work, we can try to arrange other times.
    * I also tend to reply to questions on Teams.
* I will hold office hours online while we are in code blue or code teal.
  (Also if we reach code yellow, code red, or code infrared.)
* You'll learn more introductory stuff when you read the syllabus.

### Apologies

* I am old.  My hearing is not great, even with hearing aids.
* Our Web site is not as up to date as I'd like.  But it will be.  Soon.
  Ish.
* I am traditionally bad at names+faces.  I will be worse with masks.  It
  will take me some time to learn your names.
* More to come ....

### Upcoming activities

Guidelines

* You can earn "tokens" (more info follows) for attending designated
  academic events or supporting your classmates in their pursuits.
* Attend (or watch recording within a day or so) and **record a one-paragraph 
  reflection asap afterwards**.
* Only those activities I list count.
    * But you can suggest others.  In fact, you *should* suggest others.
* Unless otherwise specified, these each earn one token.  

Events

* Track and Field, Saturday, Field House (time tba)
* Harris Center movies when sponsored by Popcorn House

### Upcoming work

* [Read the Web site and answer questions](../assignments/syllabus).  Due
  Thursday at 10:30 p.m.
* [Tell me about yourself](../assignments/intro-survey).  Due
  Thursday at 10:30 p.m.
* [Read things in preparation for the second day of class and report on those things] Due Tuesday at 8:00 p.m.
    * [An intro to the course](../readings/fundhum-intro)
    * [Our Linux workstations](../readings/linux)
    * [Algorithm building blocks](../readings/algorithm-building-blocks)
    * [The DrRacket programming environment](../readings/drracket)
    * [An abbreviated introduction to Racket](../readings/racket-intro)
    * _Note that readings responses are generally due in the early evening
      so that I can review them before class._

### Attendance

* Sam will (attempt to) call you by first name.
* You will respond with 
    * "Hi, my name is PROPER FAMILY.  (FIRST LAST)
    * (Optional pronouns.)
    * I prefer to be called NAME.
    * If you must call me by last name, please call me Mr./Ms./Mx./Scholar
      FAMILY NAME.
    * This semester , I am excited about ....
    * _Optionally, ask me a question. You'll also have another chance later._
* Note: For the first few weeks of class, please say your name each time
  you ask or answer a question.

### Excited About

* Work with the amazing CSC-151 students.
* Covering people with color.  (And having the 151 students participate.)

### Q&A

Are we going to learn how to make Web sites?

> Yes.

Using the same technology that Sam uses?

> Probably not.  It's finicky.

Which of the following terms is best: sweet, cool, wicked, nice, ...

> ???

What do you do other than teach CS?

> Sleep.

> Eat.

> Shower.

> Exercise.

> Read books.

> Binge watch stupid TV shows.  Legends of Tomorrow, Legacies,
  Ghosts (US), Ghosts (UK), Discovery of Witches, Ted Lasso,
  ...

> Play board games.

> Write.

> Make snarky comments.

Why are we using Racket?

> It's small.  

> It's different than most other languages, which helps level the playing field.

> The differences encourage appropriate ways of thinking about computation.

> It's one of the few languages that permits beautiful code.

> It's harder to Google (bad) answers to questions.

Why did you skip me?

> General incompetence.  Sorry.

Does this class require self learning?

> I don't think you learn by having me stand or sit at the front
  of the room and tell you stuff.  I believe you learn by doing.
  I spend a lot of time designing readings (which are equiv to
  the lectures I would have given, perhaps less snarky) and labs.

> You will learn by doing.  Is that self learning?  Maybe.  Is
  it better than lecture.  Definitely.  (Research evidence that
  I can't cite proves it.)

What book would you recommend?

> _Princess Bride_, a fun light read.

> _Weapons of Math Destruction_, which discusses the negative consequences
  of using computers in decision-making processes.

What are the disadvantages of using Racket?

> Fewer people know it.  (If it's the only language on your resume,
  it doesn't help as much with jobs.)

How many languages does Sam know?

> Not enough natural languages.

> Too many programming languages.

How does learning an artificial/programming language relate to
learning a natural language?

> Both have a vocabulary; you need to learn "words" to communicate.

> Both have a syntax, a way you put things together.

> Both have a semantics, a model for how interpret/understand things.

> But ...

> Humans adapt fairly well to mistakes in the syntax of natural languages.

> Computers adapt poorly to mistakes in the syntax of programming languages

> Programming languages tend to have formally specified syntax/semantics;
  human languages evolve, often uncontrolable.

What is computer science?
-------------------------

* Computer science is the study of *algorithms* and *data
  structures*
    * Algorithms: Sets of (unambiguous) instructions.
    * Data Structures: Ways to organize information.
* We study algorithms by  ...
    * writing algorithms to accomplish certain tasks.  
      (E.g., Organizing or searching information.)
        * identify problems
        * generalize / simplify 
        * write instructions that allow "you" to solve them
    * analyzing their efficacy.
    * writing systems that implement those instructions (e.g., hardware 
      or languages).
    * considering their effects on individuals or society.
* We study data structures in similar ways.
* Most of this class will be writing and thinking about sets of
  instructions in an artificial language (aka a programming language).
    * We use an artificial language because artificial languages
      can be designed to be less ambiguous.  (Also easier for the
      computer to follow.)

Exercise
--------

_Practice writing algorithms!_

1. Form groups of people with the same playing card value as you.

2. Sam will describe a problem.

3. You will start to write an algorithm.

4. Sam will start to run your algorithm.

5. You will continue writing your algorithm.

6. Sam tries to run again.
