Administrivia
-------------

### Introductory notes

* Thank you to those of you who posted corrections in your reading questions.
  I enjoy awarding tokens.
* The College required me to post midterm assessments yesterday.
  Unfortunately, midterm assessments don't match well with the mastery
  grading we use in this course, particularly since the graders have not
  graded redos and you have not had a chance to do SoLA 2.  Take your
  midterm assessments with a large grain of salt.
* It appears that Gradescope misled me about the readings for class 15;
  I'll get the rest of those graded soon.
* Our graders are trying hard to catch up on grading.

### Class mask policy

* Please bring your mask to class.  Wear it if you wish.
* If your partner is wearing a mask, please put on your mask.
* As a member of a high-risk group, I will be wearing a mask at least 
  through spring break.

### Reminders

* Please say your name when you ask or answer a question (even if I've
  just called you by name).
* Evening tutors are available 7--10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday as
  well as 3--5 p.m. on Sunday.
* Mentor sessions are Monday 8--9 p.m.  Wednesday, 8--9 p.m., Sunday 4--5 p.m.

### Upcoming work

* No reading for Friday.
* Today's lab due Thursday at 10:30 p.m.
    * As usual, "SAM SAID I CAN STOP HERE"
* SoLA 2 released today at 2:30 and due Thursday the 10th at 10:30 p.m.
* Quiz 7 due Sunday at 4pm: Use higher-order procedures

### Upcoming Token-Generating Activities

* THURSDAY 11 a.m., JRC 101: Scholars' Convocation: Greg Duncan '70.

### Other Upcoming Activities

Sample Quiz 7
-------------

_Use `section` and composition to simplify computations._

Consider the following procedures

```drracket
;;; (vowel? char) -> boolean
;;;   char : char?
;;; Determine if char is a vowel.
(define vowel?
  (let ([vowels (string->list "aeiou")])
    (lambda (ch)
      (integer? (index-of vowels (char-downcase ch))))))

;;; (count-vowels str) -> integer?
;;;   str : string?
;;; Count the number of vowels in str
(define count-vowels
  (lambda (str)
    (tally vowel? (string->list str))))

;;; (select-special-words words) -> list-of string?
;;;   words : list-of string?
;;; Selects all the special words in words using the ALTV criterion.
(define select-special-words
  (lambda (words)
    (filter (o (section > <> 2) count-vowels) words)))
```

a. What kinds of words does `select-special-words` select?

b. Explain how `(o (section > <> 2) count-vowels)` works as a
predicate for such words.

c. Rewrite `vowel?` using `section` and composition but no
`lambda`.

### Bonus hard question

_You are unlikely to receive a problem this hard._

Consider the following procedure.

```drracket
(define silly
  (lambda (lst)
    (map (lambda (x) (sqr (+ 1 x)))
         (filter odd? lst))))
```

Rewrite the procedure using `o` and `section` so that it has *no* lambdas.

Notes:

* Use `o` when you want to sequence actions. (Do *this* to the parameter,
  then *this* to the result, then *this* to the next result, and so on 
  and so forth.)
* Use `section` when you want to fill in one or more parameters to a 
  procedure, thereby creating a new procedure.
* This is a case in which the lambda-free version is likely much harder to
  read.

Racket/Lab Stuff
----------------

### The local bindings self check

Rewrite `v2c-ratio` so that we don't duplicate work.

#### Original

```
;;; (v2c-ratio str) -> rational?
;;;   str : string
;;; Determine the ratio of vowels to consonants in str
(define v2c-ratio
  (lambda (str)
    (/ (tally vowel? (string->list str))
       (tally consonant? (string->list str)))))
```

#### Rewritten (without `let`)

```
(define v2c-helper
  (lambda (lst)
    (/ (tally vowel? lst)
       (tally consonant? lst))))

(define v2c-ratio
  (lambda (str)
    (v2c-helper (string->list str))))
```

#### Rewritten (with a local helper)

```
(define v2c-ratio
  (let ([helper
         (lambda (lst)
           (/ (tally vowel? lst)
              (tally consonant? lst)))])
    (lambda (str)
      (helper (string->list str)))))
```

or

```
(define v2c-ratio
  (let ([helper
         (lambda (lst) (/ (tally vowel? lst) (tally consonant? lst)))])
    (lambda (str)
      (helper (string->list str)))))
```

#### Rewritten, substituting the local helper

_Sam will attempt this "live", perhaps with help._

```
(define v2c-ratio
  (let ([helper
         (lambda (lst) (/ (tally vowel? lst) (tally consonant? lst)))])
    (lambda (str)
      (helper (string->list str)))))
```

_No, I don't expect you to do this._

### Termial and natural numbers

```
> (natural? 0)
#t
> (natural? 1)
#t
> (natural? 4)
#t
> (natural? -1)
#f
> (natural? 1.0)
#f
```

Moral: If we say that something expects a natural number, we mean
"an exact non-negative integer".

### Quiz 6

While I won't put answers in the eboard, I will go over it in DrRacket.

### The bad range procedure

Here's the "bad" version of `range` from the lab

```
(define bad-range
  (lambda (n)
    (if (zero? n)
        null
        (cons n (bad-range (- n 1))))))
```

As you might have noted, this gives us the values in the wrong order.
Although it's inefficient, we might consider adding a `reverse` to
the mix to get them in the right order.

```
(define less-bad-range
  (lambda (n)
    (if (zero? n)
        null
        (reverse (cons n (less-bad-range (- n 1)))))))
```

Will this work? (Ignore the inefficiency.)

Here's another approach.  Since we're putting the values at the wrong
position, just swap the parameters to `cons`.

```
(define lesser-bad-range
  (lambda (n)
    (if (zero? n)
        null
        (cons (lesser-bad-range (- n 1)) n))))
```

Will this work?


Questions
---------

### Reading questions

Why do we include `(lambda () ...)` in the definitions of random
functions?

> The `lambda ()` makes it a function, which means that we execute
  the body each time it is called, giving ourselves the opportunity
  to get different results.  If we don't have the lambda, it's just
  a value, and it does not change (at least in one run of the program).

### Other issues

### Preparation

* Don't forget to wear your mask if your partner is wearing a mask.
* Have the normal 'start-of-lab' discussion.
