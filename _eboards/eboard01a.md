Administrative stuff
--------------------

_Please take a playing card, if you didn't already._

### Introductory Notes

* Hi, I'm Sam (or SamR).
* Our class mentors are ...
    * Cassandra
    * Quang
    * Here to help you with the class in general.
    * Folks who will wander around during class and answer and ask quetions.
    * Folks who will hold weekly mentor sessions.  AN hour-long review
      session or time to work on homework or ....
    * Our mentors have lives/work outside of mentoring.  Do not (ab)use
      them outside of their normal hours.
* The class Web site is at 
  <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2022Sp/>.
    * I will email you the link.
    * The class Web site is (always) a work in progress, but is
      particularly behind this year.  Sorry!
* CSC-151 is *an introductory course in computer science*.
    * You can succeed (and even excel) with no prior experience.
      (Those with no prior experience sometimes spend more time.)
    * We approach material differently than many other intro courses;
      prior experience may help, but it may also hinder.  For example,
      we will not let you re-assign variables.  (Don't worry if you
      don't know what that means.)
* CSC-151 is *a community*.  We come from multiple cultures and backgrounds.
  Treat each other with respect and learn to appreciate what each person
  can contribute.
    * We will return to this issue and the associated learning outcomes
      throughout the semester.
* I type our online class notes in a format called "markdown".  You should
  find it relatively readable.  It permits me to make "nice" Web pages.
    * Sam: Don't forget to show off today's eboard.
    * Ideally, things should update automatically on the Web.  (They
      didn't today.  Computers are evil.)
    * Don't just rely on my notes; There is good evidence that taking your 
      own notes helps you learn.
* I will record some of our class sessions using Teams.

### Other introductory stuff

* The CS department maintains a mailing list.  Let me know if you'd like
  to be added.  (Conveniently, the question is on our intro survey.)
* We provide supplies in this classroom to support you in working
  and learning.
    * Small cards to serve as flashcards, which are a good learning technique.
    * Also medium-sized grided post-it pads.
    * And pens.
* I prefer to have you book office hours.  First priority in any time
  slot goes to those who book.  https:/bit.ly/book-samr
* I will hold office hours online while we are in code blue or code teal.
  (Also if we reach code yellow, code red, or code infrared.)
* You'll learn more introductory stuff when you read the syllabus.

### Apologies

* I am old.  My hearing is not great, even with hearing aids.
* Our Web site is not as up to date as I'd like.  But it will be.  Soon.
  Ish.
* I am traditionally bad at names+faces.  I will be worse with masks.  It
  will take me some time to learn your names.
* More to come ....

### Upcoming activities

Guidelines

* You can earn "tokens" (more info follows) for attending designated
  academic events or supporting your classmates in their pursuits.
* Attend (or watch recording within a day or so) and **record a one-paragraph 
  reflection asap afterwards**.
* Only those activities I list count.
    * But you can suggest others.  In fact, you *should* suggest others.
* Unless otherwise specified, these each earn one token.  

Events

* None yet.

### Upcoming work

* [Read the Web site and answer questions](../assignments/syllabus).
  Due Thursday at 10:30 p.m.
* [Tell me about yourself](../assignments/intro-survey).
  Due Thursday at 10:30 p.m.
* Read things in preparation for the second day of class and report on those things.  Due Tuesday at 8:00 p.m.
    * [An intro to the course](../readings/fundhum-intro)
    * [Our Linux workstations](../readings/linux)
    * [Algorithm building blocks](../readings/algorithm-building-blocks)
    * [The DrRacket programming environment](../readings/drracket)
    * [An abbreviated introduction to Racket](../readings/racket-intro)
    * _Note that readings responses are generally due in the early evening so that I can review them before class._

### Attendance

* Sam will (attempt to) call you by first name.
* You will respond with 
    * "Hi, my name is PROPER-NAME FAMILY-NAME
    * (Optional pronouns.)
    * I prefer to be called NAME.
    * If you must call me by last name, please call me Mr./Ms./Mx. NAME.
    * This semester , I am excited about ....
    * _Optionally, ask me a question. You'll also have another chance later._
* Note: For the first few weeks of class, please say your name each time
  you ask or answer a question.

### Excited About

* Forcing students to write their names on masks.
* Mentoring the class [x2]
* Learning about a new topic.
* Taking the first clas sin the CS major [x2]
* Exploring lots of new classes [x4]
* Taking CS classes [x2] for the first time [x3] to learn a new subject
* Free time
* Extreme cold
* Snow [x2]
* Sports season (remind us about matches)
* Learning weird new programming syntax
* Learning to code well (this student is optimistic)
* Discovering what CS is.
* Coding again, not in an anegnieering class.
* Typing in cool fonts.
* Coding on my laptops

### Q&A

Are we using DrRacket as our IDE?

> Yes.

What's an IDE?

> A TLA for "Integrated Development Environment" - Where you develop software.

What's a TLA?

> Three-letter acronym.

Will we use mulitple programming languages in this class?

> One seems like enough, for now.

> But we'll also learn a markup languags, such as HTML/XML.

Which of Sam's three sections of 151 will ask the best questions?

> We shall see.  This one asked the fewest.

What is computer science?
-------------------------

* Computer science is the study of *algorithms* and *data
  structures*
    * Algorithms: Sets of (unambiguous) instructions for solving a task.
    * Data Structures: Ways to organize information.
* We study algorithms by  ...
    * writing algorithms to accomplish certain tasks.  
      (E.g., Organizing or searching information.)
        * identify problems
        * generalize / simplify 
        * write instructions that allow "you" to solve them
    * analyzing their efficacy.
    * writing systems that implement those instructions (e.g., hardware 
      or languages).
    * considering their effects on individuals or society.
* We study data structures in similar ways.
* Most of this class will be writing and thinking about sets of
  instructions in an artificial language (aka a programming language).
    * We use an artificial language because artificial languages
      can be designed to be less ambiguous.  (Also easier for the
      computer to follow.)

Exercise
--------

_Practice writing algorithms!_

1. Form groups.

2. Sam presents a problems.

3. You develop algorithms.

4. Sam attempts to run algorithms, demonstrating ambiguity.

5. Your further develop algorithms.

6. Sam attmepts to run algorithms some more.

Debrief
-------

* You need to be very specific when giving instructions.
    * You also have to think about what's happening with shat you
      just did (e.g., is the twist tie still in Sam's hands?)
* Break complex problems into smaller problems  (Decomposition.)
    * Try your algorithm as you develop it.
* Be clean; don't have your program leave a mess.
* Know what the computer (or Sam) knows.  While "bread  and "left
  hand"  are defined, "upright" may not be.
* Things will go wrong.  When they do, it's not a problem; perhaps it's
  even funny.  (Think back to what could have happened to Sam.)
* We do better in groups.
* Be proud of yourselves, you did well.  Sam didn't die.  The sandwich
  didn't end up on the floor.
* We sometimes do the same thing more than once, so define it separately.
    * How to spread stuff on bread.
    * How to open a jar.
* Warning: Computers are sentient and malicious.
