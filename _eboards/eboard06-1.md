_Approximate overview_

* Administrative stuff [15 min]
* Questions [?? min]
* Lab [Approximately 60 min]

Administrivia
-------------

### Introductory notes

* Please say your name when you ask or answer a question (even if I've
  just called you by name).
* Don't forget that we have evening tutors available 7--10 p.m.

### Racket notes / Debrief from last lab

#### Experimentation

* The `remainder` exercise was intended to suggest that one way
  we learn about procedures is to play with them.  (We'd hope that
  the documentation is clear, but it isn't always.)

#### Types of numbers

* Complex: May have an imaginary part; may have a fractional part
* Real: No imaginary part, may have a fractional part
* Rational: No imaginary part, may have a fractional part
* Integer: No imaginary part, may have a fractional part

Notes

* All of these can be exact or inexact.
* Reals and rationals are indistinguishable.
* We tend to assume rationals are exact.

#### Rounding

What are the values of the following?

* `(round 7/2)`
* `(round -7/2)`
* `(round 9/2)`
* `(round -9/2)`

Why?

#### Converting between exact and inexact

* `(inexact->exact (exact->inexact (expt 10 50)))`

### Gradescope notes

* Gradescope doesn't let us give categorical grades, so you get numbers.
* For S/N, S is 1 and N is 0.
* For E/M/R/I, E is 3, M is 2, R is 1, N is 0.
* For everything, ignore the autograder computations (other than to see
  what you might have had problems with).
    * E.g., 1.9999 is a 1.
* We'll look at how you check grades on Gradescope.

### Upcoming work

* Readings for Wednesday due Tuesday at 10:00 p.m.
* Lab writeup from today due Tuesday at 10:30 p.m.
    * Ideally, you'll finish that in class today.
    * If not, set up a time to meet with your partners.
    * If that's not possible, finish (and submit) separately, but cite
      your partner.
* Mini-Project 2 due Thursday at 10:30 p.m.
    * On Gradescope

### Upcoming Token-Generating Activities

* Men's Tennis 9am and 5pm Saturday in the Field House.  (30 min of watching
  is enough)
* Swim meet Saturday at 1pm.  (30 min of watching is enough)

### Other Upcoming Activities

* Men's Basketball Saturday at 1 p.m.
* Women's Basketball Saturday at 3 p.m.

Reading Questions
-----------------

_I've started putting answers to the reading questions in the readings.
These are ones that didn't naturally fit in a reading_

Other Questions
---------------

What happens if you got the Decomposition quiz wrong?

> There will be a decomposition problem on SoLA 1.  If you get it 
  right, you'll now have achieved that learning objective.

What happens if you got the Decomposition quiz wrong and you get it
wrong on SoLA 1?

> There will be a decomposition problem on SoLA 2.  If you get it 
  right, you'll now have achieved that learning objective.

> But you should probably chat with me or a mentor or an evening tutor
  before you take SoLA 2, so that we can be sure you understand the
  core concepts.  We can also assign you an individual tutor if that
  will help (and you're making use of other resources).

What happens if you got the Decomposition quiz wrong and you get it
wrong on SoLA 1 and SoLA 2?

> There will be a decomposition problem on SoLA 3.  If you get it 
  right, you'll now have achieved that learning objective.

> This also holds for SoLA 4 and SoLA 5.
