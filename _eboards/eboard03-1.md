_Getting started_

* Grab a card.  The card will have a computer name and a location.
* Remember the name and location.
* Drop the card back in the jar.
* Navigate to the computer.
* If you arrive first
    * Clean up your work area with a wipe.
    * Start the lab.
* When both partners arrive, introduce yourselves.

_Approximate overview_

* Review questions
* Administrative stuff; still no attendance [10--15 min]
* A quick note from yesterday's lab
* Lab

Administrivia
-------------

### Introductory notes

* Demo of seeing grades on Gradescope.  (I hope.)
* Please say your name when you ask or answer a question (even if I've
  just called you by name).
* Don't forget that we have evening tutors available 7--10 p.m.
  Sunday through Thursday, as well as 3--5 p.m. on Sunday.
* Our mentors will be sending out a survey on times to hold review
  sessions.

### Racket notes

* I mentioned this in most classes, but I'll restate it since not
  everyone may have heard: _If you have the lab instructions open 
  on the MathLAN computer, it's much easier to copy and paste into DrRad._
* As some of you have discovered, you can use parens `()`, 
  brackets `[]`, or braces `{}`.  We prefer that you generally use
  parens, with brackets added in a few specific situations.

### "What's Sauce"

* An old aphorism: "What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander."
* Meaning: We treat people the same.  
* For this particular problem: I asked you questions, so it's only fair 
  that you ask me questions.
* Broader note: I give questions strange titles.  Feel free to ignore
  them, to try to figure them out, or to ask me (or someone else).
* Aphorism: Maxim, old saying, etc.

Fun With Math
-------------

How did you check whether or not the square-root (`sqrt`) computation
was correct?

Let's try a slightly different experiment.  (See demo in DrRacket.)
