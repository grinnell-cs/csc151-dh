* Drop the card back in the jar.
* Navigate to the computer.
* If you arrive first
    * Clean up your work area with a wipe.
    * Log in, but don't start the lab.
* When both partners arrive, introduce yourselves.

Administrivia

### Introductory notes

* I expect you to show up to class unless you are ill  (or have an
  appropriate conflict).  If you miss class, please notify me as
  to why.
* Please say your name when you ask or answer a question (even if I've
  just called you by name).
* Don't forget that we have evening tutors available 7--10 p.m.
  Sunday through Thursday, as well as 3--5 p.m. on Sunday.
* Our mentors will be sending out a survey on times to hold review
  sessions.

### Racket notes

* As I said, we're learning a new language.
    * You've learned some vocabulary (`above`, `circle`, `*`)
    * You've learned some syntax (put quotation marks around strings,
      the form of expressions)
    * You've learned some semantics (the meanings associated with
      the vocabulary; what it means to put parentheses around things)
* It's good to take notes on languages!

### Upcoming work

* Readings for Wednesday due Tuesday at 8:00 p.m.
* Lab writeup from today due Tuesday at 10:30 p.m.
    * Ideally, you'll finish that in class today.
* Mini-Project 1 due Thursday at 10:30 p.m.
    * We'll look at it.

### Upcoming Token-Generating Activities

* Swim meet Saturday.  (30 min of watching is enough)
