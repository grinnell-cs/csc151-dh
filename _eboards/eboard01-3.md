* A group activity, more or less
* Debrief on activity

Administrative stuff
--------------------

_Unless there are objections, I will record today's class._

_Please take a playing card, if you didn't already._

### Introductory Notes

* Hi, I'm Sam (or SamR).
* Our class mentors are Micah and Paul
    * They will introduce themselves.
    * The mentors help during class (ask and answer questions, protect
      you from Sam's snarkiness, etc.)
    * The mentors run mentor sessions (weekly review sessions, also
      homework help)
    * The mentors can talk about other classes in CS, serve as a 
      sounding board, etc.
    * The mentors are near-peer model students.
* The class Web site is at 
  <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2022Sp/>.
    * I will email you the link.
    * The class Web site is (always) a work in progress, but is
      particularly behind this year.  Sorry!
* CSC-151 is *an introductory course in computer science*.
    * You can succeed (and even excel) with no prior experience.
      (Those with no prior experience sometimes spend more time.)
    * We approach material differently than many other intro CS courses;
      prior experience may help, but it may also hinder.  For example,
      we will not let you re-assign variables.  (Don't worry if you
      don't know what that means.)
* CSC-151 is *a community*.  We come from multiple cultures and backgrounds.
  Treat each other with respect and learn to appreciate what each person
  can contribute.
    * We will return to this issue and the associated learning outcomes
      throughout the semester.
* I type our online class notes in a format called "markdown".  You should
  find it relatively readable.  It permits me to make "nice" Web pages.
    * Sam: Don't forget to show off today's eboard.
    * Don't just rely on my notes; There is good evidence that taking your 
      own notes helps you learn.
* I will record our class sessions with Teams.

### Other introductory stuff

* The CS department maintains a mailing list.  Let me know if you'd like
  to be added.  (Conveniently, the question is on our intro survey.)
* We provide supplies in this classroom to support you in working
  and learning.
    * Small cards to serve as flashcards, which are a good learning technique.
    * Also medium-sized grided post-it pads.
    * And pens.
* I prefer to have you book office hours.  First priority in any time
  slot goes to those who book.  https:/bit.ly/book-samr
* I will hold office hours online while we are in code blue or code teal.
  (Also if we reach code yellow, code red, or code infrared.)
* You'll learn more introductory stuff when you read the syllabus.

### Apologies

* I am old.  My hearing is not great, even with hearing aids.
* Our Web site is not as up to date as I'd like.  But it will be.  Soon.
  Ish.
* I am traditionally bad at names+faces.  I will be worse with masks.  It
  will take me some time to learn your names.
* More to come ....

### Upcoming activities

Guidelines

* You can earn "tokens" (more info follows) for attending designated
  academic events or supporting your classmates in their pursuits.
* Attend (or watch recording within a day or so) and **record a one-paragraph 
  reflection asap afterwards**.
* Only those activities I list count.
    * But you can suggest others.  In fact, you *should* suggest others.
* Unless otherwise specified, these each earn one token.  

Events

* Track and Field meet Saturday at unknown time.

### Upcoming work

* [Read the Web site and answer questions](../assignments/syllabus).  For THurssday at 10:30 p.m.
* [Tell me about yourself](../assignments/intro-survey).
* [Read things in preparation for the second day of class and report on those things]  Due Tuesday at 8:00 p.m.
    * [An intro to the course](../readings/fundhum-intro)
    * [Our Linux workstations](../readings/linux)
    * [Algorithm building blocks](../readings/algorithm-building-blocks)
    * [The DrRacket programming environment](../readings/drracket)
    * [An abbreviated introduction to Racket](../readings/racket-intro)
    * _Note that readings responses are generally due in the early evening
      so that I can review them before class._

### Attendance

* Sam will (attempt to) call you by first name.
* You will respond with 
    * "Hi, my name is FIRST LAST.
    * (Optional pronouns.)
    * I prefer to be called NAME.
    * If you must call me by last name, please call me Mr./Ms./Mx. LAST NAME.
    * This semester , I am excited about ....
    * _Optionally, ask me a question. You'll also have another chance later._
* Note: For the first few weeks of class, please say your name each time
  you ask or answer a question.

### Q&A

What does the stupid banner say about Grinnellians and questions?

> Grinnellians ask hard questions and question easy answers.

> Except in 151, where they ask easy questions so that Sam is able
  to answer them.

What languages are we learning?

> Scheme (Racket)

> HTML/XML

Readings are done before class and labs in class?

> Yes

And homework assignments?

> Out of class.  We call them Mini-Projects

And exams?

> Out of class.  We call them SoLAs.

And quizzes?

> Typically quizzes will be out of class and will represent one
  learning goal from the upcoming SoLA.

> Mostly a way of ensuring that you don't try to cram everything into
  one learning session.

When will quizzes be released?

> TBD

Who is your favorite musician?

> Ella Fitzgerald, Van Morrison, or Jonathan Richman

> My son.

Is CSC-151 intended as a weed-out class?

> No.  It's always been intended as a "draw-in" class.

How many tests do we have?

> This class has a weird grading strategy.

> There are twenty-eight basic learning goals for the class.

> Each of four exams will test seven of those.

> If you get one wrong, you can try again on the next test, and the
  next, ... (until the end of the semester).

> We do not do homework assignments on weeks that there are tests (SoLAs)
  "Sets of Learning Assessments"

> What's important is *that* you learn things, not *when* (as long as
  it's this term).  Free redos on assignments and SoLAs.

Why are we learning Scheme?

> Small language / small definition.  You can learn most of the language
  in one semester.

> Encourages / requires a different way of thinking.  We think the
  Scheme ways of thinking are good ways of thinking.  Levels the
  playing field.

> One of the few languages that permits you to write code that we
  might call elegant.

> Harder to Google bad answers to homework questions.

What is the definition of the Scheme language?

> The definition of a language normally consists of the basic words
  (actions you can do, values), syntax (how you put things together),
  and a semantics (how we interpret the things we've together).

> The definition formalizes things so that there is no (or very little)
  ambiguity.

Why do the people I talk to say that Matlab not a language?

> Because they people you talk to are underinformed or overopinionated.

> I would say that Matlab is a programming language.

What is computer science?
-------------------------

* Computer science is the study of *algorithms* and *data
  structures*
    * Algorithms: Sets of (unambiguous) instructions.
    * Data Structures: Ways to organize information.
* We study algorithms by  ...
    * writing algorithms to accomplish certain tasks.  
      (E.g., Organizing or searching information.)
        * identify problems
        * generalize / simplify 
        * write instructions that allow "you" to solve them
    * analyzing their efficacy.
    * writing systems that implement those instructions (e.g., hardware 
      or languages).
    * considering their effects on individuals or society.
* We study data structures in similar ways.
* Most of this class will be writing and thinking about sets of
  instructions in an artificial language (aka a programming language).
    * We use an artificial language because artificial languages
      can be designed to be less ambiguous.  (Also easier for the
      computer to follow.)

Exercise
--------

_Practice writing algorithms!_

1. Form groups

2. Sam will present a problem

3. You will start to write an algorithm

4. Sam will start attempting to follow the algorithm; you may learn something

5. You will continue writing the algorithm

6. Sam will continue trying to follow the algorithm

Debrief
-------

* When things go wrong, you should laugh.  And things will go wrong.
* Ambiguity happens.  Work on precision.
* Think about special cases.
* Work in teams.
