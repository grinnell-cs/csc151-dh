Administrivia
-------------

### Introductory notes

* I hope the SoLA went well.  I look forward to a weekend of intense grading.
* Since you are probably recovering from the SoLA, today will mostly be a
  talk day.
    * There is a listed lab that you might want to look at, but there's
      nothing to submit.
* Please ask questions as we go.  I'll encourage you from time to time.
* Don't forget that we spring ahead this weekend.  Plan ahead for the
  loss of sleep time.

### Class mask policy

* Please bring your mask to class.  Wear it if you wish.
* If your partner is wearing a mask, please put on your mask.
* As a member of a high-risk group, I will be wearing a mask at least 
  through spring break.
* Note: Masks remain good for preventing transmission of cold and
  flu and other similar diseases.
* The survey asks you for other thoughts on the mask policy.

### Reminders

* Please say your name when you ask or answer a question (even if I've
  just called you by name).
* Evening tutors are available 7--10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday as
  well as 3--5 p.m. on Sunday.
* Mentor sessions are Monday 8--9 p.m.  Wednesday, 8--9 p.m., Sunday 4--5 p.m.

### Upcoming work

* Quiz 7 due Sunday at 4pm: Use higher-order procedures.
* Week seven survey distributed today, due Sunday at 10:00 p.m.
   
* Reading for Monday's class (Pairs and Pair Structures), also due 
  Sunday at 10:00 p.m.
* MP 5 due next Thursday at 10:30 p.m.  Released today.

### Upcoming Token-Generating Activities

_None right now._

### Other Upcoming Activities

### Administrative questions

### The Friday PSA returns

* Choose what is right for you, not what you think others are doing.
* Take care of yourself.
* Moderation!
* Consent is essential.  
    * Go beyond consent.

Rolling dice
------------

### Starter code

```
(define play-seven-eleven
  (lambda ()
    (cond 
      [(= 7 (pair-a-dice))
       1]
      [(= 11 (pair-a-dice))
       1]
      [else
       0])))

(define pair-a-dice
  (lambda ()
    (+ (roll-a-die) (roll-a-die))))

(define roll-a-die
  (lambda ()
    (random 1 7)))
```

### Count how many times we win

```
(define count-wins
  (lambda (n)
    (cond
      ; No games -> No wins
      [(zero? n)
       0]
      ; We win (-:  Count it and move on
      [(= (play-seven-eleven) 1)
       (+ 1 (count-wins (- n 1)))]
      ; We lose )-:  Just move on
      [(= (play-seven-eleven) 0)
       (count-wins (- n 1))]
      ; ??? This should never happen
      [else
       (error "Tie!")])))
```

### Improving the code

```
(define count-wins
  (lambda (n)
    (if (zero? n)
        0
        (+ (play-seven-eleven)
           (count-wins (- n 1))))))
```

### Observe problem

8/36 rolls win.  So when we play a lot of games, we should win about 8/36
of the time.  If we play 3600 games, we should win approximately 800 times.
Do we?

### Further observations

### Morals

* It's harder to test random procedures.
* We can easily create subtle (or not so subtle) errors in simulations;
  it's good to think carefully.
    * We want to call `random` neither too few nor too many times.
* Randomness can be fun.
* `pair-a-dice` is one of the best procedure names ever.

### Dice questions

Random language
---------------

### A key procedure

```
;;; (random-list-element lst) -> any?
;;;   lst : listof any?
;;; Randomly select an element of `lst`
(define random-list-element
  (lambda (lst)
    (list-ref lst (random (length lst)))))
```

### Sample usage

```
;;; people -> listof string?
;;; A list of some of the folks who teach 151
(define people (list "Peter-Michael" "Nicole" "Sarah" "SamR" "Barbara" "Priscilla" "Jerod"))

;;; (random-person) -> string?
;;; Randomly select an element of the people list.
(define random-person
  (lambda ()
    (random-list-element people)))
```

Why does `random-person` have a `lambda` with no parameters?

How might we use this idea to generate text?

MP5
---

Our goal: Generate some interesting language.

* Haiku.
* Mad libs.
* Haiku, using words from another text.

Higher-order procedures
-----------------------

### Sample LA 1

Consider the following procedures

```drracket
;;; (vowel? char) -> boolean
;;;   char : char?
;;; Determine if char is a vowel.
(define vowel?
  (let ([vowels (string->list "aeiou")])
    (lambda (ch)
      (integer? (index-of vowels (char-downcase ch))))))

;;; (count-vowels str) -> integer?
;;;   str : string?
;;; Count the number of vowels in str
(define count-vowels
  (lambda (str)
    (tally vowel? (string->list str))))

;;; (select-special-words words) -> list-of string?
;;;   words : list-of string?
;;; Selects all the special words in words using the ALTV criterion.
(define select-special-words
  (lambda (words)
    (filter (o (section > <> 2) count-vowels) words)))
```

a. What kinds of words does `select-special-words` select?

b. Explain how `(o (section > <> 2) count-vowels)` works as a
predicate for such words.

c. Rewrite `vowel?` using `section` and composition but no
`lambda`.

### Sample LA 2 (hard!)

_You are unlikely to receive a problem this hard._

Consider the following procedure.

```drracket
(define silly
  (lambda (lst)
    (map (lambda (x) (sqr (+ 1 x)))
         (filter odd? lst))))
```

Rewrite the procedure using `o` and `section` so that it has *no* lambdas.

Notes:

* Use `o` when you want to sequence actions. (Do *this* to the parameter,
  then *this* to the result, then *this* to the next result, and so on 
  and so forth.)
* Use `section` when you want to fill in one or more parameters to a 
  procedure, thereby creating a new procedure.
* This is a case in which the lambda-free version is likely much harder to
  read.
