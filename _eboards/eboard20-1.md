### Introductory notes

* I hope the SoLA went well.  I look forward to a weekend of intense
  grading.

### Class mask policy

* Please bring your mask to class.  Wear it if you wish.
* If your partner is wearing a mask, please put on your mask.
* As a member of a high-risk group, I will be wearing a mask at least 
  through spring break.
* Note: Masks remain good for preventing transmission of cold and
  flu and other similar diseases.

### Reminders

* Please say your name when you ask or answer a question (even if I've
  just called you by name).

### Other Upcoming Activities

Racket/Lab Stuff
----------------

### Rolling dice

### Random language

### Morals

* It's harder to test random procedures.
* We can easily create subtle (or not so subtle) errors in simulations;
  it's good to think carefully.
    * We want to call `random` neither too few nor too many times.
* Randomness can be fun.
