Administrivia
-------------

### Introductory notes

* Happy Wednesday!
* I hope that you are adjusting to daylight savings time.  (I'm not sure
  that I am yet.)
* You should have received a grade summary.

### Class mask policy

* We have students in this class with immunocompromised family members
  who they will see during break.  Hence, **Masks are required.**
* We will revisit this policy after spring break, but assume they are
  also required after spring break.

### Reminders

* Please say your name when you ask or answer a question (even if I've
  just called you by name).
* Evening tutors are available 7--10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday as
  well as 3--5 p.m. on Sunday.
* Mentor sessions are Monday 8--9 p.m.  Wednesday, 8--9 p.m., Sunday 4--5 p.m.

### Upcoming work

* Reading for Friday: Hash Tables, due Thursday at 10:00 p.m.
* Today's lab due Thursday at 10:30 p.m.
    * As usual, "SAM SAID I CAN STOP HERE"
* Quiz 8 distributed Thursday at 8am, due Sunday at 4pm: Randomness.
* MP 5 due Thursday at 10:30 p.m.  

### Upcoming Token-Generating Activities

_Note: For mentor sessions, I'd like reflections and not just "this is what we did._

* Mentor session tonight at 8pm.
* Mentor session Wednesday at 8pm

### Other Upcoming Activities

* Follow baseball/softball/golf on their spring trip

Sample Quiz 8
-------------

_Write programs that produce unpredictable output._

Grinnell has suggested that we make up “random ids” for the students in our classes that we can use in online platforms.

Write a procedure, `(random-id)`, that creates a string consisting of a random six-letter identifier of the form consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel, with all letters uppercase.

```
> (random-id)
"PALEQO"
> (random-id)
"ZEDUMI"
```

Isn’t that fun?

Racket/Lab Stuff
----------------

### Converting lists to strings

One of the points of the `int-list->string` exercise was that printing
of lists is optimistic in Racket.  We assume we have a list until
proven otherwise.
