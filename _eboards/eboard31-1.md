* Questions [~30 min]
* Lab [~40 min]

Administrivia
-------------

### Introductory notes

* I have a bad cough and so I'm teaching from home today (or trying to
  teach from home).
    * I've been telling you to stay home when you seem sick, so I'm
      following the same advice.  Or at least sort of the same advice.
    * Since I may be less able to answer questions, I've moved the
      due date for MP6 to Tuesday.
* We may have admitted students (those are mostly on Friday).
* SoLA 3 has been mostly returned.  I'm still working on the data abstraction
  problem.
* There were way too many questions for today!  I don't know how much time
  we'll have for lab.
* I've been helping a variety of folks; too many have not yet organized
  the information we have.  
    * "What procedure does X?"  
    * "What does that procedure do?"
    * "What available procedures work with strings?"  
    * "Where would you look if you needed more info?"  

### Reminders

* Sam's computer remains broken.
* We will continue to wear masks until the end of the semester.  Enough
  people requested that on the survey that it seems like the best policy.
* Please say your name when you ask or answer a question (even if I've
  just called you by name).
* Evening tutors are available 7--10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday as
  well as 3--5 p.m. on Sunday.
* Mentor sessions are generally Sunday 4--5 p.m.  Monday 8--9 p.m.  
  Wednesday, 8--9 p.m.
    * This week: Ask questions about SoLA 3 and XML/SXML/etc.

### Other Upcoming Activities

Sample quiz question
--------------------

Local bindings comments
-----------------------

I found the local bindings problems useful, because they suggested that
some of you didn't realize or or both of two things.

* `let` bindings evaluate the expressions *immediately*, rather than waiting
  until the names are used.
* You can use `let` expressions *anywhere* an expression can go.  You can 
  even write something silly like `(+ 5 (let ([x (sqr 4)]) (+ x x)))`.
* Note: One thing that sets Scheme apart from many languages is that most
  expressions can go anywhere an expression can go.  We've already seen
  that you can use `lambda`s anywhere (e.g., as return values.

### The Zen of Booleans returns

`(if TEST CODE #f)` -> `(???)`

`(if (not TEST) #f CODE)` -> `(???)`.

SoLA 3 questions
----------------

Could you go over the data abstraction problem?

> Sure.  But not on the eboard.  You should take notes.

Quiz 11 comments
----------------

_These will not be on the eboard.  I'd recommend taking notes._

MP6 questions
-------------

Can you change the due date?

> Yes.

I'm having trouble decomposing.  Can you suggest some procedures?

* A lot of what we're doing is searching the data.  I'd write procedures
  that search the data.
    * `(extract-elements-by-tag tag data)`
    * `(extract-elements-by-class class data)`
    * `(extract-element-by-id id data)` ; note that this is singular
    * `(extract-field field xml)` ; Grab the first element with a particular
      tag.
* We also have to extract information from `element` and `random` tags.
    * `(extract-attribute attribute element)`
    * `(define extract-class (section extract-attribute 'class <>))`
    * `(define extract-tag (section extract-attribute 'tag <>))`
    * `(define extract-id (section extract-attribute 'id <>))`
    * `(define extract-fieldname (section extract-attribute 'field <>))`

Can you help me write `extract-element-by-id`?

> Sure.

> We'll use `sxpath-match`.  That returns a list of all matching things.
  The list should contain zero or one elements.  (Zero means no matches;
  One is the one match.)

> Our pattern should be something like `"//*[@id='ID']"`, where we fill
  in the appropriate id.

> So

> ```
;;; (id-pattern id) -> string?
;;;   id : string?
;;; Build the pattern to match a particular id.  E.g., `(id-pattern "prof")`
;;; should give `"//*[@id='prof']"`.
(define id-pattern
  (lambda (id)
    ???))

;;; (extract-element-by-id id data) -> xml? or false?
;;;   id : string?
;;;   data : xml
;;; Find the element in data with a given id.  If there is no such
;;; element, return false.
(define extract-element-by-id
  (lambda (id data)
    ???))
```

### Hop questions

Could you go over `right-section`?

> `right-section` is supposed to take a two-parameter procedure (`binproc`)
  and a single value (`right`) as parameters and return _a new procedure_
  that takes one value (`left`) as a parameter and applies `binproc`
  to `left` and `right`.

> Here's how I usually write it.

> ```
(define right-section
  (lambda (binproc right)
    (lambda (left)
      (binproc left right))))
```

> That inner `lambda` suggests that we're returning a procedure.

> If you think about something like `(define sub2 (right-section - 2))`,
  we substitute `-` for `binproc` and `2` for `right`, giving us ...

> ```
(define sub2
```

> Some people find this version easier to understand.

```
(define right-section
  (lambda (binproc right)
    (let ([newproc (lambda (left)
                     (binproc left right))])
      newproc)))
```

Could you go over `reduce-right`?

> Base case: Singleton.  Return the value.

> Recursive case: Let's suppose we successfully reduce the right.  What's
  left to do?

> For example, consider `(reduce-right + '(1 2 3 4 5))`

> Our recursive call is `(reduce-right + '(2 3 4 5))`.  If that succeds,
  it returns 14.

> We still have to add 1.

> So `(reduce-right + '(1 2 3 4 5))` -> `(+ 1 (reduce-right + '(2 3 4 5)))`

> Generalizing, we want `(op (car lst) (reduce-right op (cdr lst)))`.

> Putting it all together ...

> ```
(define reduce-right
  (lambda (binproc lst)
    ???))
```

How do I define `map` in terms of `fold`?

> It's easiest to use `foldr`.

### Racket questions

You keep writing "Do not put right parens on a line by themselves".  Should
I pay attention to that?

> Yup.  From now on, you will get a zero if you put right parens on a line
  by themselves.

### Reading questions

### Other questions

I don't see the mentor sessions I attended on my grade report.  Why not?

> You only get credit for mentor sessions for which you write reports.

But the mentors take down our names.

> Yes.  That's for other purposes.  Tokens require a multi-senetence 
  reflective essay.

Can I go beyond the one-week deadline for token reports?

> Yes, if you were confused about the mentor report policies.

Can you tell me which mentor sessions I attended?

> I suppose so.  DM or email me.
