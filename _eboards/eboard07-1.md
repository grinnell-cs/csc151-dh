Administrivia
-------------

### Introductory notes

* I hope you had a pleasant "work differently" day.
* Please say your name when you ask or answer a question (even if I've
  just called you by name).
* Don't forget that we have evening tutors available 7--10 p.m.

### Racket notes / Debrief from last lab

### Gradescope notes

* Gradescope doesn't let us give categorical grades, so you get numbers.
* For S/N, S is 1 and N is 0.
* For E/M/R/I, E is 3, M is 2, R is 1, N is 0.
* For everything, ignore the autograder computations (other than to see
  what you might have had problems with).
    * E.g., 1.9999 is a 1.
* We'll look at how you check grades on Gradescope.

### Upcoming work

* Quiz 3 Friday: Conditionals
* Readings for Friday due Thursday at 10:00 p.m.
    * DDag question
* Lab writeup from today due Thursday at 10:30 p.m.
    * Ideally, you'll finish that in class today.
    * If not, set up a time to meet with your partners.
    * If that's not possible, finish (and submit) separately, but cite
      your partner.
* Mini-Project 2 due Thursday at 10:30 p.m.
    * On Gradescope

### Sample Quiz Question

_Utilize boolean expressions and values in a program to produce conditional behavior._

As you know, we often associate words with students' standing in
college.  At Smileyville College, Those who have completed fewer
than four terms are "freshlings", those who have completed between
four and seven terms (inclusive) are "wise fools", those who have
completed between eight and eleven terms (inclusive) are "subordinates",
and those who have completed at least twelve terms are "elders".

Write a procedure, `(status terms)`, that, given the number of
terms a student has completed as input, produces a string that
describes the student using the terms above.
