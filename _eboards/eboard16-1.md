  well as 3--5 p.m. on Sunday.

* Friday readings due Thursday at 10:00 p.m.

### Other Upcoming Activities

Sample Quiz 6
-------------

_Design and write recursive functions over lists._

Write a *recursive* procedure, `(increasing-length? words)`, that takes
a list of strings as input and ensures that every string is at least as
long as the previous string. If so, it returns true.  If not, it returns
false.

Here's a partial test suite.

```drracket
(check-equal? (increasing-length '()) 
              #t
              "No strings: They are in increasing length")
(check-equal? (increasing-length? '("hello"))
              #t
              "A singleton")
(check-equal? (increasing-length? '("a" "b" "cd" "efg" "hij" "klmn"))
              #t
              "Some duplicate-length words")
(check-equal? (increasing-length? '("a" "bb" "ccc" "dddd" "eee"))
              #f
              "Okay until the end.")
```

Racket/Lab Stuff
----------------

### Common patterns of list recursion

You've seen a few common patterns of list recursion.

* How to find an extreme value in a list.
* How to tally kinds of values in a list.
* How to select kinds of values in a list.

It's probably helpful to have those patterns written down somewhere.

### Testing

_Notes from Sam's observations on Monday_.

Start with straightforward tests.  Edge cases should be edgy primarily
in that they are at the "edges" of possible input (e.g., the value of
interest is at the front or end of the list).

* `(my-length '(      ))` is no different than `(my-length '())`
* `(my-length '("hello" (list 1 2)))` should be no different than 
  `(my-length '(me 2))` 
* It can be helpful to use other procedures in your tests.
  `(test-equal? "long list" (my-length (make-list 1000 'a)) 1000)`

### Tracing one version of `alphabetically-first`.  

_Sam sent this via email, so we're not going over it in class.  However,
Sam thinks it's important enough that he's reproducing it in the eboard._

Here's a way many students wrote `alphabetically-first`.

```
(define alphabetically-first
  (lambda (lst)
    (cond
      [(null? (cdr lst))
       (car lst)]
      [(string-ci<=? (car lst) (alphabetically-first (cdr lst)))
       (car lst)]
      [else
       (alphabetically-first (cdr lst))])))
```

This solution is correct.  However, it can have some unexpected behavior.
Let's trace a few examples.  I'm going to shorten it a bit for tracing.
(You may want to verify to yourself that it's the same.)

```
(define af
  (lambda (lst)
    (if (null? (cdr lst)) (car lst) (if (string-ci<=? (car lst) (af (cdr lst))) (car lst) (cdr lst)))
    ))
```

    (af '("a" "b" "c"))
    ; Expand the call to af
--> (if (null? (cdr '("a" "b" "c"))) (car '("a" "b" "c")) (if (string-ci<=? (car '("a" "b" "c")) (af (cdr '("a" "b" "c")))) (car '("a" "b" "c")) (cdr '("a" "b" "c"))))
    ; Evaluate that first `cdr`
--> (if (null? '("b" "c")) (car '("a" "b" "c")) (if (string-ci<=? (car '("a" "b" "c")) (af (cdr '("a" "b" "c")))) (car '("a" "b" "c")) (cdr '("a" "b" "c"))))
    ; Evaluate the null?
--> (if #f (car '("a" "b" "c")) (if (string-ci<=? (car '("a" "b" "c")) (af (cdr '("a" "b" "c")))) (car '("a" "b" "c")) (cdr '("a" "b" "c"))))
    ; (if #f CONSEQUENT ALTERNATIVE) -> ALTERNATIVE
--> (if (string-ci<=? (car '("a" "b" "c")) (af (cdr '("a" "b" "c")))) (car '("a" "b" "c")) (cdr '("a" "b" "c")))
    ; Evaluate the `car`
--> (if (string-ci<=? "a" (af (cdr '("a" "b" "c")))) (car '("a" "b" "c")) (cdr '("a" "b" "c")))
```

### Writing `tally-odd`

So many options!

```
(define tally-odd-a
  (lambda (numbers)
    (cond
      [(null? numbers)
       0]
      [(odd? (car numbers))
       (+ 1 (tally-odd-a (cdr numbers)))]
      [else
       (tally-odd-a (cdr numbers))])))

(define tally-odd-b
  (lambda (numbers)
    (cond
      [(null? numbers)
       0]
      [(even? (car numbers))
       (tally-odd-b (cdr numbers))]
      [else
       (+ 1 (tally-odd-b (cdr numbers)))])))

(define tally-odd-c
  (lambda (numbers)
    (if (null? numbers)
        0
        (if (odd? (car numbers))
            (+ 1 (tally-odd-c (cdr numbers)))
            (tally-odd-c (cdr numbers))))))

(define tally-odd-d
  (lambda (numbers)
    (if (null? numbers)
        0
        (+ (if (odd? (car numbers)) 1 0)
           (tally-odd-d (cdr numbers))))))

(define tally-odd-e
  (lambda (numbers)
    (if (null? numbers)
        0
        (+ (abs (remainder (car numbers) 2))
           (tally-odd-e (cdr numbers))))))

(define tally-odd-f
  (lambda (numbers)
    (if (null? numbers)
        0
        (+ (modulo (car numbers) 2)
           (tally-odd-f (cdr numbers))))))
```
