What did you take from the trees lab?

* "I now know how to build and traverse trees using a binary tree library."

Questions
---------

### MP7 questions

Does time spent preparing the presentation count toward the six hours?

> If you spend time on the presentation before the due date, yes.

Does meeting time planning the project count?

> Yes.

When is the presentation due?

> 7:00 a.m. Monday morning.

How should we submit our presentation?

> PDF or local Powerpoint: Upload to Gradescope

> Online Powerpoint on GrinCo: Share with me, DM me on Teams

> Online Google Doc: Share with rebelsky@gmail.com, DM me on Teams

> Other: Share with me, DM me.

When will we decide on presentation order?

> Friday.  Talk to your team about when you'd like to go.

Will we get examples of previous presentations?

> No.  Shoot for 5-10 minutes, show off your code (running and details),
  be prepared to answer questions.  (be prepared to ask questions)$a

What if the code takes too long to run during class?

> Then don't run it, or find a way to pre-run the code.

### Reading questions

How do we find the largest value in a tree?

> See notes under lab below.

How do we search a leaf?

> We look at the value.  If it matches, we're done.  If not, we recurse
  on the left or right subtree.  Since those are empty, we don't find
  anything there.

When we recurse on both subtrees, does that happen simultaneously
or in sequence?

> In our version of Racket, in sequence.  There are languages that allow
  us to do it simultaneously.

Can we go over examples in class?

> We'll mostly go over examples in lab.
