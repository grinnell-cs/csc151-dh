  the same.
* For those who want short video/audio chats: You can always check with 
  me on Teams.  "Are you available to chat?"
* Don't forget that we have a reference page with a list of most of
  the procedures you've learned.  (If you've learned one and don't
  see it, let me know and I'll add it.)
* Let me know if you did NOT receive an update via email yesterday.
* Please ...
    * Use the Q&A channel for general questions.
    * Add a subject to your questions so that others can skim them.
    * Skim the Q&A channel before asking a question.
* Please don't ...
    * Post your code to the Q&A channel.
    * Tell people how to solve problems.  You can suggest procedures
      that might help, but part of the goal is that you think about
      how procedures might help.
* I did not respond to questions after 9pm or so.  I probably won't
  get to those until this evening.
