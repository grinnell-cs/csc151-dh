Questions
---------

### From the readings (not discussing)

### From the readings (discussing)

What should the J-r-d code look like?

```
; Brute force
(define j-r-d/1
  (rex-any-of (rex-string "Jerod")
              (rex-string "Jared")
              (rex-string "Jered")
              (rex-string "Jarod")))

; A bit more elegant
(define j-r-d/2
  (rex-concat (rex-string "J")
              (rex-char-set "ea")
              (rex-string "r")
              (rex-char-set "eo")
              (rex-string "d")))
```
