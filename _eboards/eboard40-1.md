Administrivia
-------------

### Introductory notes

* Beware!  Friday the 13th falls on Friday this month.
* Happy last day of classes!  (Or sad ...)
* I appreciate the Grinnell Parents Facebook Group's discussion of CS.

### Friday PSA

* People care about you.  Take care of yourself.
* Make the choices that are right for you, not the choices you think others
  want you to make (or are making for themselves)
* Moderation!  (Perhaps even in sleep.)
* Consent is essential.  
    * Arguably, consent is necessary, but not sufficient.
    * "You don't climb a mountain without first making plans."

### Upcoming work

* SoLA 5 (optional)
    * Released Tuesday, 17 May 2022 at 8:00 a.m.
    * Due Friday, 20 May 2022 at 5:00 p.m.

### Upcoming Token-Generating Activities

* Mentor session Monday of Finals Week (8pm)

### Other Upcoming Activities

Questions
---------

I've overspent my tokens.  What happens?

> Traditionally, you lose a reading, lab, or LA for each two tokens you've
  overspent.  (I try to pick the one that is least harmful.)

> This semester: I'm wiping the slate clean (as of 8am today).  You now have
  `(max current-tokens (+ base-tokens section-tokens))`

> `base-tokens` are the three tokens everyone started with plus the
  extra one you earned for reviewing the mentors.

> `section-tokens` are the tokens you earned as a section for, say, a high
  response rate on one of the surveys.  Section 1 has 4 section tokens.

> Note: I have not reviewed recent tokens.  Let me know if you have questions.

I took an extension on SoLA 4.  When is it due?

> Saturday at 10:30 p.m.

Peer Reviews
------------

_15 min_

Your names are on the board.  For each of the five names that come after
you, write the name on the blank side of the card and something positive
about the person on the other.  If you have extra time, you can write on
more cards (choose whoever you want).

"The subject matter(s) of the course"
-------------------------------------

_20 min_

The end-of-course evaluations have five questions that read "_blah
blah blah_ helped me understand the subject matter of the course".
When we first started using College-wide EOCEs, I asked "How will
students know what the subject matter of the class is?  After all,
students call CSC 151 'The Scheme Course', even though our primary
focus is functional problem solving, and CSC 152 'The Java Course',
even though its focus is algorithms and data structures."  The
response "You can tell them."  But that's not my style.

So we're going to collaboratively develop a list of things you may
have learned in CSC 151 this semester.  I tend to group them into
categories.  

* I'll describe the categories and give an example for each.
* I'll give you some time to come up with suggestions.  
* We'll talk through them for a bit.
* I'll probably take photos and record them in the eboard at a later date.

### Problem Solving 

_General strategies for approaching problems, computational and otherwise._

* E.g., We've learned to *decompose* a complex problem into smaller
  problems (subroutines) and then combine those solutions back into
  the broader solution.  For example, in learning how to make some
  kinds of sandwiches, we might also solve the problem of "spread
  stuff on bread".

### The core of CS: Algorithms and data structures

_CS is the study of algorithms and data structures; ways to manipulate
data and ways to organize data._

* E.g., We've learned about the "List" data structure, which organizes
  information in sequential order and which you can visit element by
  element using `car` and `cdr`.

### Functional programming

_CSC 151 uses an approach that we term "functional programming" and that
is somewhat distinct from other approaches._

* E.g., "Functions are first-class values": They can be parameters to
  other functions, they can be returned by other functions.  For
  example, `o` is a function that takes two unary functions as
  parameters and returns a new function that applies the two in sequence.

### Program and software design

_We've also learned a bit about how you build software (or at least how
you might build software)._

* E.g., Document your procedures so that others can understand them.

### Scheme and Racket

_We've grounded most of that learning in the Scheme/Racket programming
language.  Along the way, we've learned a bit about Scheme._

* E.g., Scheme's evaluation strategy: Evaluate the arguments, then
  apply the procedure.
    * Some exceptions: `if`, `and`, `or`, `quote`, `cond`, ...
* E.g., You've learned a bunch of procedures for making simple images,
  such as `square` and `overlay`.

### Digital humanities

_We've seen a bit of how computers can serve as a tool in humanistic
inquiry._

* E.g., gathering simple information about a text, such as the most
  common words and how frequently they appear.

### General skills

_I would hope that most Grinnell classes teach you things beyond the
basic disciplinary subject matter._

* E.g., Practice thinking on your feet.

### And beyond

_When I was about your age, my mother, who was a professor of Psychology,
told me that she planned to conduct a study on how faculty serve as moral
models for their students.  I was a snarky young man, so I said something
like "Mom, don't be silly.  While you serve as a moral model to your
students" (and she did), "most faculty are not moral models"._

_But after a few years of teaching, I started hearing from my students
that the way I approach the class does, in fact, provide some models for
how one might approach the world.  I'm still not sure that I'd call it
"moral modeling", but there are things I hope you take away from the
class that go beyond the subject matter and skills._

* E.g., Support those around you; they are amazing people.

_5 min_

Come up with two or three for each category.  (You don't necessarily
have to approach the categories in order.)

* Problem Solving 
* The core of CS: Algorithms and data structures
* Functional programming
* Program and software design
* Scheme and Racket
* Digital humanities
* General skills
* And beyond

Peer Reviews, Continued

_15 min_

End of Course Evaluations
-------------------------

_15 min_

Evaluation forms may be found at <https://grinnell.smartevals.com>.

_End-of-course ratings enable you to give responsible feedback for your
professors, and the information you provide enters into future contract
reviews. The agree/disagree responses will be tallied to produce frequency
reports. The instructor will be able to review your unidentified comments
within the electronic course evaluation system. Please note that the
scale starts with “Strongly Disagree” at the top. Be careful not
to inadvertently reverse your responses. **Please provide comments**
but do not write your name in the comment boxes. Instructors receive the
unidentified, completed forms only after grades have been submitted to
the registrar._

Note that Sam's form has a few extra questions.
