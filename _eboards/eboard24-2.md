Racket/Lab Stuff
----------------

As I reviewed the reading responses on vectors, I noted that there
was some confusion on `vector-set!`.  The `vector-set!` procedure,
like most procedures that end in an exclamation point, returns
nothing.  You call it only for the side effect of changing the vector.

You'll discover that `hash-set!` and `hash-remove!` also don't
return anything.

Questions
---------

### Reading questions

Can you explain the difference between immutable and mutable hash tables?

> You'll find that it's much like vectors: You can add and change
values in mutable hash tables, but you can't do so in immutable
hash tables.  We'll explore those differences in lab.

Can you have multiple authors for a single book?

> You could choose to associate a list of authors with a title,
rather than a single author.

> For example, 

  ```
  (hash-set! book-authors "Goodnight Moon" 
                          '("Margaret Wise Brown"
                            "Clement Hurd"))
  ```

### Other issues

Are office hours still online?

> Yup.  The surge of the new Omicron variant suggests they should be.

Can I meet with you outside of office hours?

> Certainly.  Propose a time using the Outlook/Teams scheduler.

Will there be an opportunity for a second redo of MP1 and MP2?

> Yup.  It will cost two tokens to do so.

Have you updated tokens recently?

> I will tonight.  If all goes well, they'll also be part of the grade sheet.
