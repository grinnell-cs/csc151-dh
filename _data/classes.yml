  summary: |
    We explore the problem of *sorting*.  When you sort a list,
    vector, or other collection, you put the elements in order.
    The order of the elements usually corresponds to the type of
    the elements.  We might sort strings alphabetically, grades
    numerically, colors by brightness, and so on and so forth.
    We also reflect on one common sorting algorithm.
