    - "**Dictionaries**.  Design and write functions that use dictionaries."
    - "**Vectors**.  Design and write functions (potentially recursive functions) that use vectors."
    - "**Data abstraction**.  Design data structures to separate interface from implementation."
    - "**Higher-order procedures**. Use `section` and composition to simplify computations."
    - "**Precondition testing**.  Verify the preconditions of procedures."

- assessment: Learning Assessments, Phase 4 (LAP 4)
  goals:
    - "**Structure textual data**. Write and use HTML, XML, and CSS."
    - "**Write higher-order procedures**.  Write procedures that take procedures as parameters and return procedures as results."
    - "**Tail recursion**.  Transform recursive functions into tail-recursive functions."
    - "**Tree recursion**.  Design and write recursive functions over trees."
    - "**Running time**.  Use a mental model of computation to count the relevant number of operations performed by a function."
