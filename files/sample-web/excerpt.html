<p>
  Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous
  memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought
  struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came
  some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.
</p>

<p>
  The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil
  for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for
  him, and at last he panted out, <q class="spoken king">My dear! I really must get a thinner
  pencil. I can’t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things
  that I don’t intend—</q>
</p>

<p>
  <q class="spoken white-queen">What manner of things?</q>
  said the Queen, looking over the book
  <span class="aside">
    (in which Alice had put
    <q class="written alice">The White Knight is sliding down the poker. He balances very badly</q>)
  </span>
  <q class="spoken white-queen">That's not a memorandum of <em>your</em> feelings!</q>
</p>

<p>
  There was a book lying near
  Alice on the table, and while she sat watching the White King
  <span class="aside">
    (for she was still a little anxious
    about him, and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case
    he fainted again)
  </span>, she turned over the leaves, to find some
  part that she could read,
  <q class="introspective alice">—for it's all in some language I don't know,</q>
  she said to herself.
<p>

<p>
  It was like this.
</p>

<blockquote class="poem mirrored written">
  <p class="title">Jabberwocky.</p>
  <div class="stanza">
    <p class="line">'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p>
    <p class="line continuation">Did gyre and gimble in the wabe</p>
    <p class="line">All mimsy were the borogoves,</p>
    <p class="line continuation">And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>
  She puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck
  her. <q class="introspective alice">Why, it’s a Looking-glass book,
  of course! And if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the
  right way again.</q>
</p>

<p>
  This was the poem that Alice read.

  <q class="spoken alice">It seems very pretty,</q> she said when she had
  finished it, <q class="spoken alice">but it’s <em>rather</em> hard to
  understand!</q> (You see she didn’t like to confess, ever to herself,
  that she couldn’t make it out at all.) <q class="spoken alice">Somehow
  it seems to fill my head with ideas—only I don’t exactly know
  what they are! However, <em>somebody</em> killed <em>something</em>:
  that’s clear, at any rate—</q>
