; +-------------------------+----------------------------------------
; | Exercise 0: Preparation |
; +-------------------------+

#|
We repeat the preparation instructions here as a reminder of what
you need to get done to make the lab work.
|#

#|
a. Have the traditional start-of-lab discussion.  That is, introduce
yourselves; discuss working strategies, strengths, and weakness; and
review the reading.
|#

#|
b. Save this file as `transforming-xml.rkt`.
|#

#|
c. You'll need a variety of packages for this lab.  If you haven't done
so already, install the following packages in DrRacket using File ->
Install Package....

* `html-parsing`
* `html-writing`
* `sxml`
* `https://github.com/grinnell-cs/csc151www.git#main`
|#

#|
d. Make a copy of [excerpt.html](../files/sample-web/excerpt.html),
which you may recall from a recent lab.
|#

#|
e. Read the file `excerpt.html` into the variable `excerpt`.
|#

(define excerpt
  (file->xml "excerpt.html"))

#| A |#

; +----------------------------------+-------------------------------
; | Exercise 1: Exploring quotations |
; +----------------------------------+

#|
As you may recall, `excerpt.html` contains a short excerpt from
_Through the Looking Glass_.
|#

#|
a. Write an expression that identifies all of the quotations in that
document.
|#

(define excerpt-quotations
  ???)

#|
b. Write an expression that identifies all of the quotations by the
White Queen.  You may have to review the list you just made to see
how we have marked such quotations.

Note that for elements with multiple classes, you will likely want
to use a pattern like

    "//TAG[contains(@class, 'NAME')]"

You will, of course, substitute a different tag and class name.
|#

(define white-queen-says
  ???)

#|
c. Write an expression that identifies all of the spoken quotations.
|#

(define excerpt-spoken-quotations
  ???)

#| B |#

; +----------------------------------+-------------------------------
; | Exercise 2: Off with their heads |
; +----------------------------------+

#|
a. Write an expression that replaces every one of the White Queen's
quotations with the text "Off with their heads!".  Note that 
`sxpath-replace` needs a procedure as the third parameter.  It's
probably easiest to make it a separate procedure, although a lambda
expression might also work.

You can check the result by saving to a file with

    > (xml->file white-queen-now-says "temp.html")

and then opening the file in a Web browser.
|#

(define white-queen-now-says
  ???)

#|
b. Write an expression that removes every one of the White Queen's
quotations.  Once again, you can check the result by saving to a
file with

    > (xml->file silence-the-white-queen "temp.html")

and then opening the file in a Web browser.
|#

(define silence-the-white-queen
  ???)

#| A |#

; +--------------------------+---------------------------------------
; | Exercise 3: Reformatting |
; +--------------------------+

#|
a. Write an expression that strongly emphasizes every spoken quotation .
That is, put a `strong` tag around the quotation.  Once again, you may
find a helper useful. (this one will simply add a string tag around
some XML.)  Once again, you may want to preview the result in a Web
browser.
|#

(define speak-strongly
  ???)

#|
b. Write an expression that turns every spoken quotation into all caps.
That is, identify the text within the quotation and call `string-upcase`
on that text.
|#

(define cap-says
  ???)

#| B |#

; +-----------------------------+------------------------------------
; | Exercise 4: Dequoting Alice |
; +-----------------------------+

#|
Write an expression that removes the `q` tag from any of Alice's quotations.
|#

(define dequote-alice
  ???)

#| A |#

; +----------------------------+-------------------------------------
; | Exercise 5: Inserting text |
; +----------------------------+

#|
Write an expression that inserts the text `"PAY ATTENTION:"` at the
start of every quotation.  

Reminder: You can use `append` to join lists.  In this case, you'll
want to join a list of the tag (and, possibly, the attributes), a
list of the string, and the rest of the contents of the element.

Note that this process is complicated by the possible inclusion of 
attributes in the quotation.  Fortunately, there's a 
`(has-attributes? element)` procedure that checks whether or not there's
a set of attributes.
|#

(define pay-attention
  ???)

; +----------------+-------------------------------------------------
; | Time to submit |
; +----------------+

#|
Make sure to submit both the racket file and the excerpt.html file.
|#

; +---------------------------+--------------------------------------
; | For those with extra time |
; +---------------------------+

#|
Start working on the next mini-project.
