This lab consists of a number of programming and reasoning exercises
about booleans and conditionals.  Start with the A-side exercises with
A-side driving and B-side navigating.  Then switch back and forth as
indicated.

#|

1. Make sure to introduce yourself to your partner.

2. Make sure to save this file as `conditionals.rkt`.

3. Optional: Review the Q&A.

|#

#| A |#

; +---------------------------------+--------------------------------
; | Exercise 1: Conditional tracing |
; +---------------------------------+

#|
Consider the following code snippet:
|#

(define foo
  (lambda (x1 x2)
    (if (< x1 x2)
        #t
        #f)))

(define bar
  (lambda (x1 x2)
    (< x1 x2)))

#|
Here's a trace of two similar expressions.

    (foo 2 4)
--> (if (< 2 4) #t #f)
    ; Evaluate the test
--> (if #t #t #f)
    ; The test is truish; Use the consequent
--> #t

    (bar 2 4)
--> (< 2 4)
--> #t

Remember that to trace an `if` expression, you first evaluate the guard
(the first "parameter" to `if`).  If the guard holds, you replace the
`if` with the consequent (the second "parameter" to `if`).  If the guard
does not hold, you replace the `if` with the alternate (the third "parameter"
to `if`).

Give execution traces for each of the following expressions.  Check
with the interactions pane that your final value coincides with the
result of evaluating the expression in Racket.
|#

#|
a. (foo 5 3)

<TODO: give your trace here>
|#

#|
b. (bar 5 3)

<TODO: give your trace here>
|#

#|
c. What do you see as the similarities and differences between
`foo` and `bar`?

<TODO: give your answer here>
|#

#| B |#

; +---------------------------+--------------------------------------
; | Exercise 2: More tracing! |
; +---------------------------+

#|
Consider the following code snippet:
|#

(define baz
  (lambda (x1 x2 x3)
    (if (< x1 x2)
        (if (< x2 x3)
            #t
            #f)
        #f)))

(define qux
  (lambda (x1 x2 x3)
    (and (< x1 x2) (< x2 x3))))

#|
Here are some execution traces.

    (baz 2 3 4)
--> (if (< 2 3) (if (< 3 4) #t #f) #f)
    ; Evaluate the test
--> (if #t (if (< 3 4) #t #f) #f)
    ; The test is truish; use the consequent
--> (if (< 3 4) #t #f)
    ; Evaluate the test
--> (if #t #t #f)
    ; The tst is truish; use the consequent
--> #t

    (qux 2 3 4)
--> (and (< 2 3) (< 3 4))
    ; Evaluate the first argument to `and`
--> (and #t (< 3 4))
    ; The first argument is truish; drop it
--> (and (< 3 4))
    ; There's only one argument to and, use it
--> (< 3 4)
--> #t

    (baz 3 2 4)
--> (if (< 3 2) (if (< 2 4) #t #f) #f)
    ; Evaluate the test
--> (if #f (if (< 2 4) #t #f) #f)
    ; The test is false, use the alternate
--> #f

    (qux 3 2 4)
--> (and (< 3 2) (< 2 4))
    ; Evaluate the first argument to `and`
--> (and #f (< 2 4))
    ; When the first argument to `and` is false, the result is false.
--> #f

Give execution traces for each of the following expressions.  Check
with the interactions pane that your final value coincides with the
result of evaluating the expression in Racket.
|#

#|
a. (baz 2 3 1)

<TODO: give your trace here>
|#

#|
b. (qux 2 3 1)

<TODO: give your trace here>
|#

#|
c. Why did we choose those three example inputs (that is, "2 3 4",
"3 2 4" and "2 3 1")?

<TODO: give your answer here>
|#

#|
d. What do you see as the similarities and differences between
`baz` and `qux`?

; +---------------------------------------------+--------------------
; | Exercise 3: Mixing conditionals and numbers |
; +---------------------------------------------+

#|
In this exercise, we continue learning how to work with the primitive
types and their standard library functions.  Use functions from the
Racket standard library to implement the following common functions
that utilize booleans.

When you are done, you should experiment with your function in the
interactions pane on a variety of inputs to verify that the program
works as expected.
|#

#|
a. Write a predicate `(is-even? n)` that takes an integer as input
and returns true if `n` is even and false otherwise.

You may not use the built-in `even?` or `odd?` predicates.

You may, however, use the `remainder` procedure you recently learned.
|#

(define is-even?
  (lambda (n)
    ???))

#|
b. In your experiments with `is-even?`, you may have determined that
`is-even?` reports an error when `n` is not an integer.

Write a predicate, `(is-even-integer? n)`, that returns true when
`n` is an even integer and false otherwise.  

Your procedure should return false when `n` is a complex number, a
non-integer real, a string, an image, and, well, anything that's
not an integer.
|#

(define is-even-integer?
  (lambda (n)
    ???))

#|
c. Write a function (number-not-integer? n) that returns true if `n`
is a number that is not an integer and false otherwise.
|#

; TODO: write your function here!

#|
d. Write a function, `(median-of-three x y z)`, that takes three
real numbers as input and returns the number that is the middle
value of the three when put in nuerical order.  If two numbers are
the same, you can return that number.  If all three are the same,
you can return that number.
|#

; TODO: write your function here!

#| A |#

; +-------------------------+----------------------------------------
; | Exercise 4: Boolean Zen |
; +-------------------------+

#|
a.  In a previous exercise, you wrote a function, `is-even?` that
determines whether a number is even.  Consider the following functions
that uses `is-even?` to determine if both of its parameters are even.
|#

(define really-bad-both-even?
  (lambda (n1 n2)
    (if (equal? (is-even? n1) #t)
        (if (equal? (is-even? n2) #t)
            #t
            #f)
        #f)))

#|
For example:

> (really-bad-both-even? 2 4)
#t
> (really-bad-both-even? 1 2)
#f

We claim that this implementation is "really bad" not because it
produces the wrong answer, but because it is sylistically offensive!
First, rewrite this function as `bad-both-even?` below using `and`
and `or` to remove the need for a nested conditional expression.

Experiment with `bad-both-even?` on a variety of examples to gain
confidence that your function works identically to
`really-bad-both-even?`.
|#

(define better-both-even?
  (lambda (n1 n2)
    ???))

#|
b. If your implementation of `better-both-even?` still contains a
conditional, then you still have more work to do!  Rewrite the
function one more time as `both-even?` below that uses neither `if`
nor `cond` in its implementation.  Again, experiement with `both-even?`
and a variety of examples to ensure that it works identically to
the previous implementations.
|#

(define both-even?
  (lambda (n1 n2)
    ???))

#|
c. The process of reimplementing `both-even?` so that it is better
designed while keeping its behaviror the same is called "refactoring".
Refactoring this function tells us something profound about booleans
and expressions, a concept that some faculty in the CS department
picked up from Stuart Reges at the University of Washington called
"boolean zen" (or "Boolean Zen").  In this class, we often use the
slightly more verbose "The Zen of Booleans".

Suppose that I have a piece of code that looks as follows:

    (if <expr> #t #f)

Where `<expr>` is a Boolean expression.  Based on `both-even?` or
the code tracing exercises, describe what I can rewrite this code
to that is equivalent to the original version but more concise.  In
a few sentences, describe and justify your answer.

<TODO: give your rewritten code and explanation here!>
|#

#|
d. Finally, use the concept of the Zen of Booleans to write a concise
version of the function `(both-odd? n1 n2)` that returns true only
when both of its arguments are odd integers.  (n.b., simply negating
`both-even?` won't work since `both-even?` will return false if one
argument is even and the other is odd!)

You may not use the `odd?` predicate here, but you may use the
`is-even-integer?` predicate you wrote earlier.
|#

(define both-odd?
  (lambda (n1 n2)
    ???))

; +---------------------------------------------+--------------------
; | Exercise 5: Mixing conditionals and strings |
; +---------------------------------------------+

#|
In this exercise, we continue learning how to work with the primitive
types and their standard library functions.  Use functions from the
Racket standard library to implement the following common functions
that utilize booleans.

When you are done, you should experiment with your function in the
interactions pane on a variety of inputs to verify that the program
works as expected.
|#

#|
a. In a particular company, employees are given IDs that consist of
a string of 6 digits, e.g., "419109".

Write a function, `(employee-id? str)`, that takes a string as input
and determines whether the string is a valid employee id.  You need
not check that `str` is a string.

> (employee-id? "123456")
#t
> (employee-id? "1")
#f
> (employee-id? "000111")
#t
> (employee-id? "00011x")
#f
> (employee-id? 123456)
Boom!  Crash!

Hint: `string->number` may help.  `string-length` may help.  `substring`
may help.
|#

; TODO: write your function here!

#|
b. The founders of the company are given IDs where the first 3
digits are 0s, e.g., "000110".

Write a function `(founder-id? sstr)` that takes a string as input and
determines whether the string is a valid founder's ID.

Note that you should use `employee-id?` to ensure that the id is a
valid employee id.

Hint: `substring` may help with the additional check.
|#

#| B |#

; +------------------------------+-----------------------------------
; | Exercise 6: Friendly prompts |
; +------------------------------+

#|
The situation frequently arises where a program will need to
check whether a user says "yes" to a prompt.

a. Write a procedure, `(yes? str)`, that takes a string as input and
determines whether the string is "yes".

> (yes? "yes")
#t
> (yes? "no")
#f
> (yes? "oui")
#f
> (yes? "y")
#f
|#

; TODO: write your function here!

#|
b. As a courtesy to users, we might want to permit three inputs,
"yes", "Yes", and "y".  Write a procedure `(friendlier-yes? str)`
that returns true if the input string `str` is any of those three.

> (friendlier-yes? "yes")
#t
> (friendlier-yes? "no")
#f
> (friendlier-yes? "oui")
#f
> (friendlier-yes? "y")
#t
|#

; TODO: write your function here!

; +-------------------------------+----------------------------------
; | Exercise 7: Converting grades |
; +-------------------------------+

#|
There are a variety of ways of turning numeric grades in the range
0.0-4.0 into letter grades.  Here's one.

* Greater than or equal to 3.5: A
* Between 2.5 (inclusive) and 3.5 (exclusive): B
* Between 1.5 (inclusive) and 2.5 (exclusive): C
* Between 0.5 (inclusive) and 1.5 (exclusive): D
* Less than 0.5: F

Translate this table into a function `(gpa->letter g)` that takes
a grade point average, a fraction in the range 0 ≤ g ≤ 4.0, and
returns the corresponding letter (as a string) associated with that
grade point value. Because there are many different cases, your
implementation should `cond` rather than `if`.

As before, you should experiement with your function on a variety of
inputs in the interactions pane to ensure that the function works.
|#

(define gpa->letter
  (lambda (g)
    ???))

; | For those with extra time |
; +---------------------------+

#|
If you find that you have extra time, you might want to attempt
one or more of these exercises.
|#

; +-------------------------------+----------------------------------
; | Extra 1: Atypical cond blocks |
; +-------------------------------+

#| 
You need not submit your answers to these questions, but you should
make sure to attempt them.
|#
   
#|
As you have no doubt noticed, the blocks in a `cond` statement
normally have the form

    [guard
     consequent]

However, it turns out that they can have a variety of other forms.
Experimentally determine answers to each of the following questions
about alternate forms.
|#

#|
a. What happens if a block has more than one consequent?

<TODO: Enter your answer here>
|#

#|
b. What happens if the guard returns a value other than #t or #f?

<TODO: Enter your answer here>
|#

#|
c. What happens if a block has no consequents and the guard holds?

<TODO: Enter your answer here>
|#

#|
d. What happens if a block has no consequents and the guard returns
false (`#f`)?

<TODO: Enter your answer here>
|#

#|
e. What happens if a block has no consequents and the guard returns
a value other than true (`#t`) or false (`#f`)?

<TODO: Enter your answer here>
|#

#|
f. What happens if a `cond` statement has no `else` and none of the
guards hold?  (That is, all of the guards return false?)

<TODO: Enter your answer here>
|#

; +----------------------------+-------------------------------------
; | Extra 2: Be more forgiving |
; +----------------------------+

#|
In one of the lab questions, you were asked to write a forgiving
`"Yes"` prompt checker.  If you have additional time, work with
your partner on enhancing this checker so that it accepts other
reasonable forms of "Yes", including other words, e.g., "Yup",
abbreviations and short-hands such as "Y", and strange capitalizations,
such as "yeS".
|#

; +-------------------------------+----------------------------------
; | Extra 3: Cleaner computations |
; +-------------------------------+

#|
In our experience, most of you wrote `gpa->letter` with the "B" test
looking like this.

```
    [(and (< g 3.5) (>= g 2.5))
     "B"]
```

However, it is possible to write that without the `and` (and even
without the 3.5).  If you wrote something long like that, rewrite
your `gap->letter` to be more efficient.

If you are puzzled, ask one of the staff for help.
|#

; +-------------------------------------+----------------------------
; | Extra 4: Median of three, revisited |
; +-------------------------------------+

#|
Earlier, you wrote `median-of-three`.  Write a version of `median-of-three`
without conditionals.  (You may not use `and` or `or`.)

Hint: You may find that `max` and `min` help.
|#

(define new-median-of-three
  (lambda (x y z)
    ???))
