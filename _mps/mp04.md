  In this project, you will employ a variety of tools you have learned
  to visualize some aspects of texts.

  Each student should submit their own set of solutions to this project.
  You may certainly consult others in developing the project, although
  you should cite or acknowledge them if you have done so.

Over the past few weeks, you have learned and employed a variety
of types, tools, and techniques.  For example, you have written
programs that analyze texts to determine characteristics of those
texts (often using regular expressions) and you have written programs
that make images.  You have also learned recursion, testing,
documentation, style, and more.

In this project, you will employ these techniques to develop something
others might use to quickly understand some characterisics of a text.

## The basics

Although the tools we have created to analyze texts produce results,
the results are only in the form of numbers and words.  However, some
people seem to better undestand information provided in visual
form.  (Some people find it more difficult to understand information
provided in visual form; for example, those with visual impairments
will be better off with textual or numeric summaries.  Ideally, we
would support multiple kinds of users.)

Write a program that can read an *any* text file (e.g., one of the
texts from Project Gutenberg) and produces a useful visualization
of some charactersitics of that text.  You may choose what you want
to visualize and how you want to visualize it.

Your goal is that the visualization provide useful information about
texts in a way that others might easily understand.  And, as noted,
it should work with any reasonable text file.

Once you've written the program, use it to comparatively "analyze" two
texts of your choice.

*Please spend between three and four hours on this project.*

## Required components

You must employ the following tools in your project in non-trivial ways.

* **Regular expressions.**  That is, you should write at least one 
  non-trivial regular expression.
* **Text analysis.**  That is, you should read from a file and compute
  one or more attributes of the text (Dale-Chall score, average sentence
  length, common words, etc.)
* **Images.**  That is, you should generate images using the tools we
  learned at the start of the course.
* **Testing.**  That is, you must test some of your procedures.  In particular,
  you should provide tests that demonstrate that your regular expression
  behaves in the way you intend it to.

As always, you should document your procedures and follow our conventions
for style.

## What to submit

* Your Racket code, in a file named `text-visualization.rkt`
* Two or more text files that you have analyzed.  You may use whatever
  name you consider appropriate.
* The results of a sample analysis, in a file named "analysis.png".  You
  can create that file with `(save-image img "analysis.png")`.

## Additional notes

* Your instructor will almost certainly display the results of your work 
  (the images) in class.  They may even ask you to talk about those results.

## Rubric

_We may modify this rubric slightly._

### Necessary for R

```
[ ] Includes `text-visualization.rkt`.
[ ] Includes `analysis.png`.
[ ] Includes necessary text files.
[ ] Runs when **Run** is clicked.
[ ] Raacket file includes header.
```

### Necessary for M

```
[ ] At least one non-trivial regular expression.
[ ] Reads from a file and computes some characteristic of the text in that file.
[ ] Creates an image that varies depending on that characteristic.
[ ] Includes tests of some component of the project.
[ ] All procedures are documented.
[ ] Reasonable style.
```

### Necessary for E

```
[ ] Works reasonably with most text files, not just those chosen by the author.
[ ] Particularly creative visualization.
[ ] Novel (or moderately novel) analysis.
[ ] Excellent style.
