title: Mini-Project 6
subtitle: Building Web pages
summary: |
  In this assignment, you will write programs that generate (or attempt to generate) Web pages using templates and ata sets.
collaboration: |
  Each student should submit their own responses to this assignment. You may
  consult other students in the class as you develop your responses.  You
  may also consult with the normal host of other folks: Mentors, tutors,
  SamR, Grinnell CS students, random strangers on the Web, and so
  on and so forth.  If you receive help from anyone, make sure to
  cite them in your responses. You do not need to cite course pages
  you were instructed to read for this assignment.

Please name your file `html-generation.rkt`.  Starter code may appear in the near future.

## Background

Many Web pages are not written by hand.
Rather, they are generated automatically by a program that grabs data from one place and fits it into a template.
Of course, someone has often written the template by hand.
And someone has written the program that puts the data in a usable format.
And, um, someone has written the program that puts data into the template.

In this project, you will write a program that builds new Web pages by substituting text from one file into another file.

## The big picture

Write a procedure, `(build-page data template result)`, that takes three strings as parameters and uses them to build a Web page.
`data` names an XML file that contains data (which will be surrounded by the `data` tag).
`template` names an XML file that contains the template.
`result` is the name of the file that your procedure should create.

The template will primarily by HTML (well, XHTML, but it's close enough) along with two special singleton tags.

* The `element` tag grabs an element from the data file.  For example,
  `<element id="foo"/>` should grab the contents of the element named
  `foo`.  One can also specify a field from the element with
  `field="NAME"`.  For example, `<element id="prof" field="last-name">`
  should grab the field named `last-name`.
* The `random` tag grabs a random element of a particular type from
  the data file.  Types can be specified by their outermost tag with
  `tag="TAG"`, by their class, with `class="CLASS"`, or by both.
  Once again, we can include a `field` attribute to grab one field.

For example, here's a very simple data file for our class.

```
<data>
  <name id="sam" class="prof"><first>Samuel</first> <middle>Alexander</middle> <last>Rebelsky</last> <nickname>SamR</nickname></name>
  <name id="river" class="mentor"><first>River</first> <middle>B</middle> <last>Lake</last> <nickname>River</nickname></name>
  <name id="elle" class="mentor"><first>Lindsey</first> <middle>L<middle> <last>Lasty</last> <nickname>elle</nickname></name>
  <topic id="recursion" class="fun">Recursion</topic>
  <topic id="vectors" class="mutable">Vectors</topic>
</data>
```

Here's a template for a randomly generated topic.

```
<p>When <element id="sam" field="nickname"/>'s presentation of
<random tag="topic"/> is too confusing, I go to 
<random class="mentor" field="nickname"/> for help.</p>
```

That should become something like

```
<p>When Sam's presentation of reursion is too confusing, I go to
Elle for help.</p>
```

To earn an E, you'll need to permit data that includes `element` and
`random` tags.  (That is not necessary for an M.)

## Evaluation

We will primarily evaluate your work on *correctness* (does your code
compute what it's supposed to and are your procedure descriptions
accurate); *clarity* (is it easy to tell what your code does and how
it acheives its results; is your writing clear and free of jargon);
and *concision* (have you kept your work short and clean, rather than
long and rambly).  In a few cases, we will also consider the
*creativity* of your result.
